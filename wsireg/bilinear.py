"""Harmonize patch level registrations of a large image using bilinear interpolation.

This module turns separate patch registrations into a single global Displacement Vector Field
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_field_(mechanics).

Use cv2.remap() to apply the DVF- for very large images you may need to tile the image and DVF (untested).
The patch-level registrations can be obtained however you like, but this module should
interface smoothly with patchreg.py.

Note that this module requires fully overlapping patches in order to perform alignments:
Image:
a b c d e
f g h i j
k l m n o
p q r s t

Patches:
[ab fg] [bc gh] [cd hi] [de ij]
[fg kl] [gh lm] ...
[kl pq] ...
